# LoxLex

A collection of lexer implementations for use with [Lox](https://dcaiafa.github.io/lox), the parser generator for Go.

## Overview

LoxLex provides reusable lexer implementations that integrate seamlessly with parsers generated by Lox. Currently, the library includes:

- **SimpleLexer**: A lightweight, memory-based lexer that reads the entire input upfront. Tokens reference byte slices of the original input. The implementation is minimal and can be copy-pasted directly into your project if you prefer to avoid external dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/dcaiafa/loxlex/simplelexer
```

Or simply copy `simplelexer/lexer.go` into your project.

## Usage

Import SimpleLexer in your Lox-based project:

```go
import "github.com/dcaiafa/loxlex/simplelexer"
```

## Examples

For examples of SimpleLexer in action, see the [Lox examples](https://github.com/dcaiafa/lox/tree/main/examples) which all use SimpleLexer as their lexer implementation.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher
- [Lox](https://dcaiafa.github.io/lox) parser generator (for regenerating test files)
